# Preface {-}

I like birds and spend a bunch of free time staring at birds. I created this book to store all my bird lists. 

If you're interested in birds and are based in Kenya please consider using the **Kenya BirdLasser app**. It helps you document sighting while providing important inputs to conservation and scientific efforts. You can download the app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lasser.birdlasserkenya&hl=en) and check out all the cool stuff they do [here](http://kenyabirdmap.adu.org.za/).
